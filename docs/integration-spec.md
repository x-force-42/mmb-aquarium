# Mr. Meeseeks Aquarium — Integration Spec

> Audience: the team writing the **producer** side of this integration
> (the system whose state the aquarium will visualize).
> Status: **interface frozen for v1**; transport-level details (URL, auth,
> heartbeat) are open and need decisions from the producer team — see the
> "Open questions" section at the end.

## What this is

The aquarium is a visualization front-end. Each item alive on screen — a
"Meeseeks" — represents one unit of work in your system. You produce a
stream of small JSON messages; the aquarium reflects those messages as
creatures being born, working, suffering, dying or being relieved.

You don't need to know how the aquarium renders — that's our problem. You
just need to push the right messages at the right time. The interface is
intentionally minimal: **three message types, five lifecycle events, one
continuous metric (health)**. Nothing else.

The contract is one-way: you push, we render. There are no client → server
messages in v1 (no acks, no requests, no commands back).

---

## Transport

- **Protocol:** WebSocket. Plain text frames carrying UTF-8 JSON, one
  message per frame.
- **URL pattern:** TBD by the producer team (see Open questions). The
  aquarium client takes it as a configuration parameter at boot, so any
  URL works.
- **Direction:** producer → aquarium only.
- **Reconnect:** the aquarium will reconnect on disconnect (exponential
  backoff, capped). The producer **must send a fresh `snapshot` as the
  first message on every new connection** — see "Operational contract"
  for why.

---

## Message schema

Every frame is a JSON object with a discriminator field `type`. Three values:

### 1. `snapshot` — full state, sent on connect

Tells the aquarium "this is the complete current state; drop everything
else." Used at connect time and whenever the producer needs to resync.

```json
{
  "type": "snapshot",
  "meeseeks": [
    {
      "id": "task-42",
      "health": 0.83,
      "isFreakingOut": false,
      "name": "Mr. Meeseeks",
      "task": "rebalance shard 7"
    },
    {
      "id": "task-118",
      "health": 0.21,
      "isFreakingOut": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Field by field:

| Field           | Type             | Required | Notes                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------- | :------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `meeseeks`      | array of entries |   yes    | May be empty (`[]`) — that's a valid "nothing is alive" snapshot.                            |
| `id`            | string           |   yes    | Stable per work unit. Should be **unique** across the producer.                              |
| `health`        | number `[0, 1]`  |    no    | Defaults to `1`. Clamped on receipt — out-of-range values get pinned to `[0, 1]`.            |
| `isFreakingOut` | boolean          |    no    | Defaults to `false`.                                                                         |
| `name`          | string           |    no    | Friendly label shown briefly above the sprite at birth.                                      |
| `task`          | string           |    no    | Friendly description of what the unit is doing. Currently surfaced only on hover/inspection. |

### 2. `state` — continuous health update

Tells the aquarium "this unit's health is now X." Health is **absolute**,
not a delta. The aquarium will animate the color transition from old to new.

```json
{ "type": "state", "id": "task-42", "health": 0.74 }
```

| Field    | Type            | Required | Notes                                   |
| -------- | --------------- | :------: | --------------------------------------- |
| `id`     | string          |   yes    | Must match an existing Meeseeks.        |
| `health` | number `[0, 1]` |   yes    | Absolute new value. Clamped on receipt. |

Unknown `id` → silently dropped (the aquarium logs a warning; the producer
is expected to be the source of truth, so we don't ask). Same-value updates
are idempotent — sending the current health again is a no-op.

### 3. `event` — discrete lifecycle event

Tells the aquarium "something discrete happened to this unit." Triggers a
specific animation (and a voice clip, see the audio system).

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "id": "task-42",
  "kind": "born",
  "name": "Mr. Meeseeks",
  "task": "rebalance shard 7"
}
```

| Field  | Type   | Required | Notes                                                                      |
| ------ | ------ | :------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`   | string |   yes    | The work unit this event applies to.                                       |
| `kind` | enum   |   yes    | One of `born`, `died_happy`, `died_defeated`, `freaking_out`, `recovered`. |
| `name` | string |    no    | Only used on `born`. Sets the floating-name label.                         |
| `task` | string |    no    | Only used on `born`. Sets the task hover label.                            |

Semantic of each `kind`:

| `kind`          | Meaning                                                                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `born`          | A new unit just started. Aquarium spawns a new sprite at full health.                              |
| `died_happy`    | Unit completed its work successfully. Sprite plays the celebratory death animation and disappears. |
| `died_defeated` | Unit failed / was given up on. Sprite plays the somber death animation and disappears.             |
| `freaking_out`  | Unit entered an error/crisis state. Sprite starts pulsing red, shaking, and (later) wailing.       |
| `recovered`     | Unit exited the freak-out state. Sprite calms down. The unit stays alive.                          |

The aquarium tracks `isFreakingOut` as a flag separate from `health` — a
unit can be at 90 % health and still freaking out, or at 5 % health and
calm.

## Operational contract

These are the guarantees the aquarium expects from the producer side, and
what the producer can expect from the aquarium.

| Topic                       | Contract                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ordering**                | Messages **for the same `id`** must arrive in causal order. Across IDs, ordering is irrelevant.                                                       |
| **Idempotency (born)**      | Duplicate `born` for an already-alive `id` is **silently dropped**. Don't worry about replays.                                                        |
| **Idempotency (state)**     | `state` with health equal to the current value is a **no-op**. Same is true if it lands before any `born` for that id (dropped).                      |
| **Idempotency (freak)**     | `freaking_out` for an already-freaking unit is **dropped**. Same for `recovered` on a non-freaking unit.                                              |
| **Unknown id**              | Any `state` or `event` for an `id` the aquarium has never heard of is silently dropped.                                                               |
| **`snapshot` is a reset**   | When a `snapshot` arrives, the aquarium **wipes** its current state and re-emits births for each entry. Use this for resync, never as a delta.        |
| **Connect resync**          | The producer **should** send a `snapshot` as the first message on every new connection. Without it, the aquarium starts empty until events flow.      |
| **Backpressure**            | The aquarium can absorb ~1000 messages/sec without dropping. Beyond that, message frames may be deferred a frame (16 ms) but not dropped on our side. |
| **Buffering on disconnect** | The aquarium does **not** buffer producer-side. If you disconnect mid-burst, send a `snapshot` on reconnect rather than replaying events.             |
| **Client → server**         | None in v1. The aquarium is read-only. Future: maybe a "request snapshot" frame from the client. Not now.                                             |

## Example sequences

### Bring a unit to life, work it, complete it

```jsonc
// 0 ms
{ "type": "event", "id": "u-001", "kind": "born", "name": "Mr. Meeseeks", "task": "compile report" }

// 2_000 ms — health falling as the work consumes patience
{ "type": "state", "id": "u-001", "health": 0.8 }
// 4_000 ms
{ "type": "state", "id": "u-001", "health": 0.6 }
// 6_000 ms
{ "type": "state", "id": "u-001", "health": 0.5 }

// 6_500 ms — finished cleanly
{ "type": "event", "id": "u-001", "kind": "died_happy" }
```

### A unit gets stuck, recovers, gives up later

```jsonc
{ "type": "event", "id": "u-002", "kind": "born", "task": "open the jar" }
{ "type": "state", "id": "u-002", "health": 0.35 }
{ "type": "event", "id": "u-002", "kind": "freaking_out" }
{ "type": "state", "id": "u-002", "health": 0.20 }
{ "type": "event", "id": "u-002", "kind": "recovered" }  // back to calm
{ "type": "state", "id": "u-002", "health": 0.05 }
{ "type": "event", "id": "u-002", "kind": "died_defeated" }
```

### Resync after a network blip

```jsonc
// 1) New connection opens
// 2) Producer immediately sends:
{
  "type": "snapshot",
  "meeseeks": [
    { "id": "u-003", "health": 0.7,  "isFreakingOut": false, "name": "Mr. Meeseeks", "task": "tail logs" },
    { "id": "u-009", "health": 0.15, "isFreakingOut": true,  "task": "drain queue" }
  ]
}
// 3) Then resumes normal streaming
{ "type": "state", "id": "u-003", "health": 0.65 }
```

## External publishers (via local relay)

The aquarium is a browser page and cannot open a listening socket. A
lightweight Node relay (`scripts/ws-relay.mjs`) bridges external producers
to the browser client:

```
External producer → relay (Node, :8080/ws) → WebSocketTransport (browser)
                         broadcasts every frame to all other connected clients
```

The relay is stateless and transparent: bytes in, same bytes out. It does
not parse, validate, buffer, or cache.

### Running

```bash
# Two separate terminals:
npm run relay    # relay on 0.0.0.0:8080/ws
npm run dev      # Vite dev server on :5173

# Or start both together with interleaved, color-coded output:
npm run dev:full
```

Set `VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws` in `.env.local` to tell the aquarium
to use `WebSocketTransport` instead of the default button-driven simulator.
Leave it unset to keep the simulator experience — that is what the e2e suite
runs against.

### Relay URL and env vars

| Env var      | Default   | Notes                                                |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`       | `8080`    | TCP port the relay binds to.                         |
| `RELAY_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address. Lock to `127.0.0.1` for loopback-only. |

Default URL (producer on the same host): **`ws://localhost:8080/ws`**

> **WSL / Docker producers.** `127.0.0.1` resolves to the _guest's_ own
> loopback, not the host's. In WSL2, find the host IP with:
> `ip route show default | awk '{print $3}'`

### Naming convention

To distinguish domain sources at a glance, prefix the `name` field:

| Prefix   | Domain              | Example `name`         |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `[W]`    | Workers / jobs      | `[W] worker-core-1234` |
| `[A]`    | Atomic agents       | `[A] aquarium-1.1`     |
| _(none)_ | Meeseeks / mmb-core | `Mr. Meeseeks`         |

Use a globally unique `id` across all producers. A safe default:
`<domain-slug>-<short-id>`, e.g. `worker-core-1234` or `agent-aquarium-1.1`.

### Minimal Python example

Requires `pip install websockets`.

```python
import asyncio, json
from websockets.client import connect

RELAY_URL = "ws://localhost:8080/ws"

async def publish():
    async with connect(RELAY_URL) as ws:
        # Announce the worker
        await ws.send(json.dumps({
            "type": "event",
            "id": "worker-core-1234",
            "kind": "born",
            "name": "[W] worker-core-1234",
            "task": "processing smoke-comm message"
        }))

        # Continuous health update
        await ws.send(json.dumps({
            "type": "state",
            "id": "worker-core-1234",
            "health": 0.6
        }))

        # Finish successfully
        await ws.send(json.dumps({
            "type": "event",
            "id": "worker-core-1234",
            "kind": "died_happy"
        }))

asyncio.run(publish())
```

## Open questions for the producer team

The aquarium is interface-frozen; the answers below are entirely the
producer team's call. We'll wire whatever you settle on.

1. **WebSocket URL / TLS.** Will the aquarium connect to `wss://your-host/aquarium`,
   `ws://localhost:port/...`, both? Single URL for everyone, or per-tenant?
2. **Authentication.** Token via `?token=…` query param? Subprotocol header?
   Cookie? Unauthenticated for now?
3. **Heartbeat / ping.** Will the producer send ping frames? Expect pings
   from the aquarium? Or rely on the WebSocket-level `pong`?
4. **Reconnect cadence.** The aquarium will retry on disconnect — what's
   a reasonable backoff curve from your side (1 s, 2 s, 5 s, 30 s cap)?
5. **Tenant model.** One aquarium per producer instance, or can one
   aquarium be fed by multiple producers? (If multiple, IDs must be
   globally unique — flag if that's a problem.)
6. **Rate.** Realistic peak message rate from your side? We're sized for
   ~1 k/sec; if you'll routinely push more, we should talk about batching.
7. **Snapshot cost.** How heavy is computing a snapshot on your end? If
   it's expensive, we'll lean on incremental events more and snapshot only
   on explicit resync; if it's cheap, we can ask for one on every reconnect.
8. **`name` / `task` policy.** Stable identifiers (always set) or only on
   `born`? Localized strings, or canonical English?

Any other ambiguity, open an issue or ping us — easier to clarify in writing
once than rediscover six weeks later.
